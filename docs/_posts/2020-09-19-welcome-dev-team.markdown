Developing code or any type of documents as a team requires a system for tracking changes and rolling systems back to a any given point. [Git][git] does all of this and more. [GitHub][github] provides a place for teams to work together on their projects.

[GitHub Pages][gh-pages] allows hosting of project documents, wikis, and web pages. A team or individual can also host a top-level website or blog utilizing [Jekyll][jekyll] on GitHub. The article in Smashing Magazine on [Building a Blog with Jekyll on GitHub Pages][jekyll-blog-gh-pages] provides an interesting read on how to use GitHub Pages for your blog (or website).

[Jekyll][jekyll] is the recommended site builder for GitHub. Creating web pages and/or blog posts can be accomplished in [Markdown][markdown] or HTML. And templates are easily built using [Liquid][liquid] which is built into Jekyll.
