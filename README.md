# Etz Chayim -Tree of Life
## Messianic Synagogue

### Welcome to Etz Chayim Messianic Synagogue of Lakeland, Florida

This site is for the web team at Etz Chayim Messianic Synagogue in Lakeland to collaborate on our new website design.

View this site at [https://etzchayimlakeland.github.io/](https://etzchayimlakeland.github.io/).

Etz Chayim Messianic Synagogue meets each Saturday morning, at 11:00 AM, for Shabbat Services at 4416 East County Rd 540-A in Lakeland, FL. For additional information, please call (863) 274-6141. At our Shabbat Services, you will be drawn into a Biblical form of praise and worship that glorifies God through Jewish Liturgy, Messianic Music, Davidic Dance, anointed teachings, and reverence for both the Old and New Covenants of Scripture. In addition, the Moedim, God’s Appointed Times (Holidays), are celebrated throughout the cycle of the Jewish calendar. Foremost, the Name of Yeshua (Jesus) is venerated, because He alone is “the way, the truth, and the life.” (John 14:6)

This site (the one you are currently viewing) is intended as a development platform for our new and improved web site.


## [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

### This project uses Jekyll

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

### Philosophy

Jekyll does what you tell it to do — no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.

See: [https://jekyllrb.com/philosophy](https://jekyllrb.com/philosophy)

### Using Jekyll

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].


## Welcome Dev Team

Developing code or any type of documents as a team requires a system for tracking changes and rolling systems back to a any given point. [Git][git] does all of this and more. [GitHub][github] provides a place for teams to work together on their projects.

[GitHub Pages][gh-pages] allows hosting of project documents, wikis, and web pages. A team or individual can also host a top-level website or blog utilizing [Jekyll][jekyll] on GitHub. The article in Smashing Magazine on [Building a Blog with Jekyll on GitHub Pages][jekyll-blog-gh-pages] provides an interesting read on how to use GitHub Pages for your blog (or website).

[Jekyll][jekyll] is the recommended site builder for GitHub. Creating web pages and/or blog posts can be accomplished in [Markdown][markdown] or HTML. And templates are easily built using [Liquid][liquid] which is built into Jekyll.
